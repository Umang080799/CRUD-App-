# CRUD-App-
I made a Crud App using Node.js,Express.js and Mongoose.js. I built out a book Schema for creating,reading,updating and deleting books.  Used Express Scripts to create routes that will form the basis for a restful API.  Used POSTMAN to perform actions on the routes All the book details were altered as JSON objects. I created and used Google Chrome to confirm the changes made on the local host server port 8080.
